# Configuration

Open Max reads `~/.openmax/settings.json` for the active endpoint and an
optional `~/.openmax/providers.json` for a catalog of named endpoints.

## Settings

```json
{
  "base_url": "http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1",
  "model": "qwen2.5-coder:7b",
  "api_key": null,
  "approval_mode": "ask",
  "max_parallel_tools": 4
}
```

`base_url` is the root of your model's HTTP API (the harness calls
`chat/completions` on it). Set `model` to the id that server expects. Set
`api_key` to a literal or `$ENV_VAR`, or export `OPENMAX_API_KEY`.
`max_parallel_tools` bounds concurrent read-only tool calls, defaults to 4, and
is clamped to 1 through 32 at runtime. Mutating, approval-gated, and
non-batchable calls remain serial.

A missing settings file means defaults, and the default `base_url` and `model`
are empty: endpoint resolution fails with an actionable error until you set
both, here or through a named provider. There is no built-in localhost
fallback. A settings file that exists but does not parse, uses an unknown key,
or sets an unrecognized `approval_mode` is a startup error (fail closed): Open
Max exits with the parse reason instead of silently reverting your endpoint and
approval policy to defaults.

## Approvals

`write_file`, `edit_file`, and `bash` wait for approval in `ask` mode. Use
`auto` for unattended runs or `readonly` to block mutating tools. Approvals and
permissions decide whether Open Max dispatches a tool call; they are not OS
isolation.

## Multiple providers

For several servers, define them in `~/.openmax/providers.json`. `/model` opens
a searchable local catalog and selects the provider and model as one pair.
Model names are optional, model ids are sent unchanged, and the configured
order is preserved within each provider. Opening the picker makes no network
requests.

```json
{
  "providers": {
    "ollama": {
      "base_url": "http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1",
      "models": [
        { "id": "qwen2.5-coder:7b", "name": "Qwen Coder 7B" }
      ]
    },
    "openrouter": {
      "base_url": "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1",
      "api_key_env": "OPENROUTER_API_KEY",
      "models": [
        { "id": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4", "name": "Claude Sonnet 4" },
        { "id": "google/gemini-2.5-pro", "name": "Gemini 2.5 Pro" }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Set `"provider"` in settings, use the provider CLI option, or use `/provider`
when you only want to change the endpoint. Optional `compat` flags cover picky
gateways (for example `max_completion_tokens` versus `max_tokens`).

Open Max works with local servers (Ollama, LM Studio, vLLM, llama.cpp), cloud
gateways (OpenRouter and similar), and private proxies.

## Project trust

An exact canonical project root must be trusted before any agent turn or
project behavior starts. Interactive use asks once; headless and stdio runs
fail closed until explicitly started with `--trust-project`.

```sh
openmax --trust-project -p "summarize this repo"
openmax --trust-project --stdio
```

Trust is persisted for the exact canonical path in `~/.openmax/trust.json`. It
authorizes the harness to run in that project; it does not sandbox project
code.
